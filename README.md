The core component of the application is the autoComplete functionality.
autoComplete  can be fully operated with the keyboard only:
Enter/Esc/Arrow down/ArrowUp/Tab

Other components are normal react components.
Axios is used for backend.
Due to shortage of time i am not able to finish the unit test part and moving to tsx for better type safety.
Will push the tests shortly.

$ git branch
master --> This branch has the earlier jsx version
typescriptversion --> This branch has the tsx version
